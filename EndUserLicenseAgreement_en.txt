We use your personal data, such as information about your activity and interests, to show you ads that are more relevant to you.
We show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We don’t sell your personal data. 

We allow advertisers to tell us things like their business goal and the kind of audience they want to see their ads. We then show their ad to people who might be interested.
We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them understand how people are interacting with their content. 
For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers to help them better understand their audience. 

We don’t share information that directly identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us specific permission.

permitted under applicable law, the Company, on its own behalf and on behalf
of its affiliates and its and their respective licensors and service
providers, expressly disclaims all warranties, whether express, implied,
statutory or otherwise, with respect to the Application, including all implied
warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title and
non-infringement, and warranties that may arise out of course of dealing,
course of performance, usage or trade practice. Without limitation to the
foregoing, the Company provides no warranty or undertaking, and makes no

the greatest extent enforceable under applicable law. To the extent any
warranty exists under law that cannot be disclaimed, the Company shall be

for personal injury, loss of privacy arising out of or in any way related to
the use of or inability to use the Application, third-party software and/or
third-party hardware used with the Application, or otherwise in connection
with any provision of this Agreement), even if the Company or any supplier has
been advised of the possibility of such damages and even if the remedy fails
of its essential purpose.

Some states/jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of
incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may
not apply to You.

such provision will be changed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of
such provision to the greatest extent possible under applicable law and the
remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.

Waiver  
------

Except as provided herein, the failure to exercise a right or to require
performance of an obligation under this Agreement shall not effect a party's
ability to exercise such right or require such performance at any time
thereafter nor shall the waiver of a breach constitute a waiver of any
subsequent breach.
